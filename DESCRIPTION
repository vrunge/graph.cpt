Description: Algorithms for detecting multiple changes within time-series with a graph-constrained structure. The detection is based on the minimization of a penalized likelihood. We use a dynamic programming algorithm called optimal partitioning with fixed state values and a transition matrix to define the accessible transitions between states. The distance function is derived from the geodesics in a Riemannian manifold. First version of this package deals with distance between symmetric positive-definite matrices.
